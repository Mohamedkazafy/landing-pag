                We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind. That's why we believe in repairs
                over replacement, wherever possible – it requires fewer materials and is easier on the planet, as well
                as your wallet! If whatever company tells you that your system needs to be replaced, just give us a call
                and we'll see if we can repair it first.

                <h3>Price</h3>
                <p>As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems tend to cost more - because we aim to make solar more
                    accessible to everybody, our prices are lower than many. We've focused on keeping prices and
                    installing the systems affordable. These lower energy costs mean less of a need for power.</p>

                <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                <p>As we've said, we do this because we believe that solar is the best direction to go, both now and in
                    the future. Solar panels are a great renewable energy source, and our aim is to get as many
                    installed as possible, helping the environment and people.</p>
